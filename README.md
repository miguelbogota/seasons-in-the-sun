# Seasons in the Sun

Season in the un is a farming, cosy and relaxing game. You can grow your own crops, raise animals,
and build your own house. The game also wants to rise awareness about veganism and the environment.

## Mechanics

- The game will have multiple NPCs, each with their own personality and dialogue with an unique
  questline for the player to complete. Upon completion of the questline, the player will be
  rewarded with a special item specific to that NPC. Each quest will also provide the player with a
  small reward (Money or items).
- The game will have a day/night cycle, with the day being 20 minutes long and the night being 10
  minutes long. During the day, the player can do whatever they want, and during the night, the
  player can sleep to skip the night and go to the next day.
- The game will have a hunger and thirst system, where the player will have to eat and drink to
  survive. If the player does not eat or drink, they will lose health. If the player's health
  reaches 0, they will die.
- The game is divided in seasons. Each season will contain different quests with rewards specific to
  that season. The seasons will also have different weather, with each season having a specific
  weather pattern.
- The game is also goal oriented, where the player will have to complete certain monuments (CTM
  style) to progress through the game. Each monument will have a multiple bundles to complete, once
  the player completes one a small reward will be given and when the player completes all the
  bundles for an monument a special reward will be given.
- The game will have a crafting system, where the player can craft items using the materials they
  have.
- The player will not have a tool durability system, where the player will not have to worry about
  their tools breaking. But the player can upgrade their tools using materials they have.
- Since the game wants to rise awareness about veganism and the environment, the player will not be
  able to kill animals. The player will have to raise animals and grow crops to obtain the materials
  they need. (Fishing will be allowed but the player can rise fish in a fish tank).
