# Seasons in the Sun

Season in the un is a farming, cosy and relaxing game. You can grow your own crops, raise animals,
and build your own house. The game also wants to rise awareness about veganism and the environment.

Running a robust web-based game comes with its challenges, and one notable downside is the lack of
asset caching. When a player opens the game, all assets must be downloaded from the server, which
can be time-consuming and far from an ideal player experience.

To address this issue, players can download an executable file (Built with Electron.js), which comes
preloaded with all necessary assets and serving them to the web game, eliminating the need for
repeated downloads from the server. Players can enjoy uninterrupted gameplay with the assurance that
their experience won't be hampered by asset loading times. This also allows players to play the game
offline and mod the assets of the game. This will only be available for computers, not mobile
devices.
